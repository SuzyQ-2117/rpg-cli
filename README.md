# rpg-cli
A Java project to work on my OOP skills - and also a bit of fun.

> Note: This is a refactor of an existing project and is still being worked on. Instructions for running/play-testing the game will be added when the code is at a playable point.
 
This is a minor README change to test the release-please workflow.
